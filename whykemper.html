	<center> <h1> Trapped in Kemper (a very short story)</h1></center>

		
<p>Days of imprisonment: 3</p>
<p>Food supplies:  Low</p>

	<p>For the last few days, I have been trapped inside the basement of Kemper.  I don’t know why this is...it’s not like the doors are locked.  The moment I come close to getting out of here something in my mind snaps, and I return to CSIF.  It’s as if someone rewired my brain and planted a command deep within my mind:  “No leaving Kemper.”
	I have to ration my food and I’m always hungry.  My sanity has all but gone.  Still, I can’t escape and so there’s nothing left to do but code.

<p>Day 4</p>
<p>Food supplies: 1 cliff bar</p>
	<p>I thought my emotions had been dulled.  I thought that hope and fear had become distant things, like half-remembered dreams or Inception references.  I was wrong.
	I saw a ridiculously huge bug in Kemper 75 and I was afraid.  It had an egg sac and when I struck it dozens of other bugs emerged.
	That’s not what scared me.  What scared me is that the original bug survived.

<p>Day 5</p>
<p>Food supplies: None</p>
	<p>There are tons of people here but I don’t think they’re...really here.  I see familiar faces but something is off.
	Every person has a ridiculously complex personality, and all the labels we put on people are mere simplifications.  This sounds strange, but the people here are the very simplifications I describe.  
	Like the ELIZA program, everyone I meet has been pre-programmed with automated responses.  No one will answer my questions about why I’m here, or how I can escape.
	The coding continues but there’s so many bugs.  They’ve already infested 75 and we’ve been forced into the less lively 71.

<p>Day 6</p>
<p>Food supplies: Trash</p>
	<p>I’ve been surviving on what I find in the wastebin.  If Kemper had not been so close to Shah’s, I would probably be dead.
	I saw the bug I had failed to kill, and it had grown to a frightening size.  It seems that the more I think about it, the more it bugs me.
	See what I did there?
	Okay but seriously I think I might die here.
<p>
Day 7</p>
<p>Food supplies: Bugs</p>
	<p>Suddenly, my fear of bugs was gone and I realized I could kill two birds with one stone.
Today, I feasted on bugs.  I know it’s really gross, but my code miraculously works now.  I have no idea why.

<p>Day 14</p>
<p>Food supplies: Good</p>
	<p>And just like that, I’ve established a routine.  I don’t eat bugs anymore.  A girl I know founded a Facebook page called food deliveries, and now I eat quite well. 
	<p>I used to be moderately annoyed that I was trapped here, then depressed that I couldn’t go to Teabo anymore.  Now I don’t mind.  I’m just...at home...and I think everyone thinks of home in a bittersweet way.  I know I do.
	Here, time doesn’t pass the same way for everyone.  I know that for three days I spend here, I age six months.  Some people age faster.  Some people don’t age at all.<p>
	I know this is my rate because when I got here I was a freshman.  Now I’m almost a fourth-year.
	Time flies, but so do bugs.
	
I’d better get back to this.
