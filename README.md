# Web-Project

URL: csiflabs.cs.ucdavis.edu/~etsoohoo

The purpose of this project was to take advantage of the free hosting feature at CSIF, the Computer Science Instructional Facility
at UC Davis.  These HTML files are shared on the CSIF server and the index.html file I wrote included instructions on how
other computer science students could create websites of their own.

The second purpose was to share my creative writing:  My poems, blog posts, and links to my short stories.
