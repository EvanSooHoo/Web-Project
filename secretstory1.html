	<p>The stowaway was a 22-year-old girl, and like all stowaways she would have to be killed.  There weren’t a whole lot of alternatives in outer space, and everyone knew what was going to happen.</p>
	<p>Everyone including her.  The captain explained the procedure and she listened with a calm indifference.  When he told her the ship could not account for her extra weight, she said she understood.  When he told her she would be ejected from the airlock and hurled to her death, she said she was not surprised.  When asked how she managed to come aboard, she explained that her own spaceship was attacked by aliens.  She was the sole survivor of a brutal attack, but her escape pod lacked the fuel to take her back to Earth.</p> 
	<p>Anything, including and especially death, was better than being captured by aliens.  It is said that they would separate the brain from the body, and then ruin both in separate steps. The brain would be hooked to a hundred sensors and overstimulated until it went insane.  Meanwhile, the brainless body would be force-fed unhealthy food.</p>
	<p>“How much time do I have?” she asked.</p>
	<p>The captain checked his watch, which was kind of a dick move on his part.  “The airlock is ready now,” he said, a fact that had nothing to do with the time on his watch. </p>
	<p>He paused and gave her a once-over.  His expression didn’t change, but an idea came to him.</p>
	<p>“Wait,” he said.</p>
	<p>“Yes?”</p>
	<p>“Are you a college student?”</p>
	<p>“I’m taking a year off.”</p>
	<p>“What’s your major?”</p>
	<p>“Computer science.”</p>
	<p>His posture straightened and his voice took on the qualities of a high-end employer.  </p>
	<p>“Computer science?  You might just be able to survive.”</p>
		<p>“How?”</p>
		<p>“Just answer a few of my interview questions.  There’s a job opening on this ship.”</p>
	<p>“Okay...”</p>
	<p>He checked his watch again.  This time, it actually had something to do with the conversation.</p>
	<p>“What is 2 to the power of 32?” he asked.</p>
	<p>“4,294,967,296.”</p>
	<p>“Given a directed graph, how would you determine if there exists at least one cycle?”</p>
	<p>“Run a depth-first search.  At least one cycle exists if and only if a back edge if present.”</p>
	<p>“Here’s a riddle.  How do you make the number one disappear?”</p>
	<p>“Add the letter G and it’s gone.”</p>
	<p>“Here’s a coding challenge,” he said, beckoning to the white board that had been there the entire time.  “You are to write three separate functions, each that takes in a string.”</p>
	<p>“What language?”</p>
	<p>“I don’t care.  The first should reverse the string, the second should compress the string, and the third should use the string as the title for a multiplayer game that is fun, polished, and compatible with both Windows and OS X.”</p>
	<p>“Sounds good.”</p>
	<p>The third challenge took her a little longer, but she finished all three in good time.</p>
	<p>“Excellent!” he said.  “You did everything perfectly.  Now, do you have any questions for me?”</p>
	<p>“How long have you had a job opening?”</p>
	<p>“We kind of haven’t.  One of our shipmates isn’t doing too well in his performance reviews.  Because you’re clearly better than him, you can take his place.”</p>
	<p>“And what will happen to him?”</p>
	<p>“We will toss him out of the airlock and you can live in his quarters.”</p>
	<p>“I don’t know if I’m comfortable with that.”
	He sighed.  “I was afraid you would say that.  Unfortunately, this company was looking for type-A personalities.”</p>
	<p>He flipped a switch.  A green light appeared on a door.</p>
	<p>“The airlock is just ahead,” he said, “I am sorry to inform you that, after much consideration, we don’t think you’re right for the position at this time.”</p>
	<p>“Thanks anyway,” she said, and prepared for the air lock release.</p>
