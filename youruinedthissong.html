			You Ruined This Song
		</center>
	</h1>

	<center> When the shades changed to a dark gray</center>
	<center> and faceless masks hid every face</center>
	<center> and words written sweetly, but unwatered, decayed</center>
	<center> this melody took me away</center>

	<br>

	<center> With a single, solid record</center>
	<center> and the slightest length of time</center>
	<center> the air turned sweet with music</center>
	<center> bright colors changed the sky</center>
	<center> I walked through golden fields</center>
	<center> I his in gorgeous lights</center>
	<center> I drank these precious seconds</center>
	<center> And loved this boundless life.</center>

	<br>

	<center> You burned those golden fields</center>
	<center> You changed this cherished song</center>
	<center>Poisoned with your memory </center>
	<center> Now every note is wrong</center>
	<center> I think of us together</center>
	<center> our love set like the sun</center>
	<center> and on that starless night</center>
	<center> you said that we were done.</center>
