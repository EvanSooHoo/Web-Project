<!-- This is my first website, and will be published via the CSIF server.  It will hopefully serve as a learning experience.  I'm just starting my third year of college, and though I've learned C, C++, x86 assembly, and some computer science theory, I still am not competent in web design.  Hopefully, this experience will change that.

style type = "text/css"
	a {color: red;} CHANGE ALL HYPERLINKS TO RED (this is called a style sheet. you could also do font:family;
	h1 {text-align: center; CENTER ALL TEXT OF A CERTAIN TYPE
	in style, to change color, do
	body
				{
					background-color: blue

				<br><br>Hello, and welcome to CSIF!  This webpage was created via the UC Davis computer science server, and if you have an account of your own then you can create a page, too.  Simply create a directory called public_html, transfer any html files you have to that location, modify the read/write privileges of each file via chmod, and access the page by using a url similar to mine [http://csiflabs.cs.ucdavis.edu/~etsoohoo/], but with your own username.

				If you are not familiar with CSIF and/or have not taken a class in the ECS series, then I apologize for that opening jargon.  I personally think it's pretty cool, even if the page is only temporary.
			</p>

				I was hoping to use this site as a central spot for my writing.  It will contain my poems, random thoughts, and links to my short stories.
