				Hello, and welcome to CSIF!  This webpage was created via the UC Davis computer science server, and if you have an account of your own then you can create a page, too.  Simply create a directory called public_html, transfer any html files you have to that location, modify the read/write privileges of each file via chmod, and access the page by using a url similar to mine [http://csiflabs.cs.ucdavis.edu/~etsoohoo/], but with your own username.
			</p>
			
			<p>If you are not familiar with CSIF and/or have not taken a class in the ECS series, then I apologize for that opening jargon.  I personally think it's pretty cool, even if the page is only temporary.</p>
		<p>I was hoping to use this site as a central spot for my writing.  It will contain my poems, random thoughts, and links to my short stories.
